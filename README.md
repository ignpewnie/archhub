# ArchHub ðŸ§­

This is free, with an optional lifetime key that is the same for everyone, and it's in the file here called `key.txt` if you want XD. The script isnâ€™t open source, but maybe one day if Iâ€™m too lazy Iâ€™ll drop it here. If you stumbled upon this and see it, just load the scripts from the files instead of `loader.lua` to bypass the key system :)

# Script ðŸ§¾
`loadstring(game:HttpGet("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ignpewnie/archhub/refs/heads/main/loader.lua"))()`
